## 🧩 Game Rules

StealthMate is a turn-based puzzle game that combines chess movement patterns with stealth mechanics:

### 🎯 Goal
- Guide your ninja character to capture all kings on the board
- Avoid being spotted by enemy chess pieces
- Complete levels in as few moves as possible

### 🎭 Characters & Pieces

- **Ninja (You)**: Move one square in any direction (like a chess king)
- **Enemies**:
  - **Rook**: Can see in straight lines (horizontally and vertically)
  - **Bishop**: Can see in diagonal lines
  - **Queen**: Can see in all directions (combines rook and bishop sight)
  - **Knight**: Can see in L-shaped patterns (just like in chess)
  - **Pawn**: Can see diagonally forward (top-left and top-right)
- **Kings**: Your targets. Capture all kings to complete the level.
- **Boxes**: Can be pushed to block enemy sight lines or capture enemies/kings.
- **Holes**: Cannot be traversed by you or boxes. Enemies can see through them.

### 🥷 Ninja Instinct

You have a special ability called "Ninja Instinct" that allows you to see enemy sight lines. Use it wisely!

- You have 3 uses per level
- Press and hold the "Ninja Instinct" button to activate
- Once all 3 uses are gone, the button turns red and cannot be used again

### 📦 Box Mechanics

Boxes are your most valuable tools:

- Push boxes by moving into them
- Use boxes to block enemy sight lines
- Push boxes into enemies to neutralize them
- Push boxes into kings to capture them
- Boxes cannot be pushed into holes

### ⚠️ Game Over

You'll lose if:
- You move into an enemy's sight line
- You try to move outside the board
- You try to push a box into a wall or another box

### 🏆 Level Progression

- Each level is locked until you complete the previous one
- Level 1 is unlocked by default
- You must complete each level to unlock the next one
- Try to beat each level in the fewest moves possible
- Your best score for each level is saved

## 🧠 Strategy Tips

- Plan your moves carefully - every step counts!
- Use boxes strategically to block sight lines and create safe paths
- Observe enemy vision patterns before moving
- Sometimes it's better to take a longer route if it's safer
- Use Ninja Instinct to check if your planned move is safe
- Remember that holes cannot be crossed, but enemies can see through them
- Knights can see through boxes, so be careful around them!
